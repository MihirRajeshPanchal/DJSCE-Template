- What is AI?
- Introduction to AI
- Total 4 credits for this subject
- Practicals based on python
- Oral and Practical examination
- No Mini project
- Imeediate checking in practicals
- 75M theory + 25M TT = 100 
- Total 6 units. (1-KW, 2...5-CB, mostly 6-KW)

COURSE OUTCOMES:
- Learn about intelligent agents
- Techniques of these agents.
- Application of AI is to represent approaches and knowledge
- Real world use cases of AI

- Look at BFS and DFS via AI 
- Some specific AI search functions
- Optimize these agents and learn diff algorithms
- AI agent should be able to capture knowledge and give solution based on a reasoning
- Uncertainity
- Plan methods of deciding a searching agent.
- Introduce ML
- AI is either NLP or autonomous bot or recommender systems or games

- ELaine RIch and Kevin Knight is good for reading like a storybook
- Russell and Norvig 2nd edition is great for understanding
- PROLOG is for practicals

WHAT IS AI?
- Simulation of Human Intelligence
- Solve problems like humans
- Man made intelligence for humans
- Self-correction and reasoning like humans
- Make a computer make decisions
- Think and act like a human
- Should make rational decisions.

Defn: Thinking humanly, acting humanly, thinking rationally, acting rationally.

- How it thinks like a human and acts like a human

DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THINK & ACT LIKE A HUMAN:
- ACTING HUMANLY
	- Turing test by Alan Turing (1950)
	- Differeniate between the machine answers and human answers
	- This will prove it to be an intelligent machine.
	
	- Should have NLP to communicate successfully
	- Store info and use it
	- ML to adapt to new environments and learn continuously
	- CV to see like humans
	- Robotics to manipulate objects physically

- THINKING HUMANLY
	- Introspection: Start following your thoughts
	- Create psychological experiments to focus on one detail at a time.
	- Combination of AI + experimental psychology

- THINKING RATIONALLY
	- Make rational/ideal approach
	- Aristotle said " Socrates ia a man. All men are mortal. Therefore I can say Socrates is mortal"
	- Laws of thought = LOGIC
	- Logic is what you apply to certain factors
	- Difficult to represent informal language in something formal.
	- Difficult to generalize logic

- ACTING RATIONALLY:
	- Agent (Software/Machine/etc) has to take a rational approach
	- Agent should achieve best expected/possible outcome. Should always give some outcome and not stop due to lack of info.
	- Acting rationally vs acting correctly.
	- ADV: More generalized that Laws of thought and more amenable to scientific development than humans.
