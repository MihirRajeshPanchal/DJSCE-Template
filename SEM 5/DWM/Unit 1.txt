DATA WAREHOUSING AND MINING (KB = Kiran Bhowmick Ma'am)

- Kindof static model. Have to make it adapt to new circumstances.
- Warehousing is related to storing, reloading and retrieving large amounts of data and maintaining it.
- Practicals in python.
- Need to write algorithms in mining instead of just calling them.
- Practicals would be interesting and tiring.
- Extensive syllabus as 2 topics.
- Diff chapters from diff books.
- 7 Units. Need to study all.

- Han, Kamber Data Mining is BIBLE
- Paulraj Pnniah is good for DW

COURSE OUTCOMES:
- Under fundamentals of DW and principles and algos of DM
- Design Sample DW with dimesnional modelling
- Understand diff DM techniques.

- Pracs will have HOD and KB
- Subject will be taught by KB


DATA MINING:
- Extracting data not openly visible
- Find patterns
- Make predictions.
- Use the vast amounts of data for productive purposes
- We are drowning in data, but starving for knowledge!
- Also known as knowledge discovery. Not knowing what we might find.
- Bussiness intelligence based on statistics.

Different ways of doing data Mining:

KDD: Knowledge discovery from data

KDD gives step wise instructions on how to extract knowledge from data you have. 

Various steps in KDD:
1) Collect huge amounts of data from db's, ledgers, excel sheets, etc.
2) Store the data in data warehouse. Consists of cleaning and integration of data. (No changing of formats)
3) Select relevent data drom warehouse and perform transformation functions to bring it in one format.
4) Apply data mining models. Requires selection of the appropriate technique.
5) Evalute the pattern and do visualization.


Data Mining includes:
	- Algorithms
	- Statistics
	- Visualization
	- Pattern Recognition
	- Machine Learning
	- Databases, etc.

- Diff types of data to be mined:
	- Streaming data
	- Transacction data
	- Text
	- Multi-media ,etc.
Techniques:
	- Data warehouse (OLAP)
	- ML
	- Statistics
	- Visualization, etc.

DATA MINING DEFN: 
	- Find hidden data
	- Fit to model
	- Exploratory data abalysis
	- Data driven discovery
	- Deductive Learning
2 TASKS:-
Predictive:
	- Classificication
	- Regression
	- Time series analysis
	- Future states prediction

Descriptive:
	- Clustering
	- Summarizing
	- Link Analysis
	- Sequence discovery

TECHNIQUES:-
CLASSIFICATION:
- Has predefined groups/classes.
- Pattern recognition
- Grouping and prediction of data

REGRESSION:
- Has a range of prediction values
- No predefined classes.

TIME SERIES ANALYSIS:
- Can be used to predict stocks based on its history
- Prediction is done over a time period
- Determine similar patterns over time
- Classify behaviors.


CLUSTERING:
- Group data based on how similar they are
- Partitioning
- E.g Housing clusterization 

SUMMARIZATION:
- Maps data into subsets with associated simple descriptions (summaries).
- Characterization
- Generalizatiom

LINK ANALYSIS:
- Find hidden relations among data
- Affinity analysis
- Association Rules
- Sequential analysis determines sequential patterns.

SEQUENCE DISCOVERY:
- Find patterns based on sequence
- e.g person goes to home page, then contact, then produccts, etc.

Data Mining: Types of Data

- What is a dataset?
-- It is a collection of data after warehousing has been done. Will be in  te form of rows and columns, .xls, .csv, etc. 
-- Rows represent one single instance/sample/object.
-- Columns represent attributes/fields/dimensions. E.g. Name, age, height, etc.
-- Data objects = instances, samples, data points, etc. 
-- Attributes = fields or features.


- Data types and attributes types.
-- Nominal / categorical attributes
-- Binary attributes
-- Ordinal
-- Numerical 

NOMINAL:
- values unrelated to numbers. Maybe Names or special symbols.
- Also called categorical values as each value represents a category
- Nominal values may be numberic. e.g cusomerID. You never require to find the mean of customerID
- Cannot find mean or median as these attributes are not quantitative.
- Finding mode is possible
- Generally finite

BINARY:
- Nominal attributes that have only 2 values - 0 and 1
- Also referred to as Boolean is values are True and False
- SYMMETRIC BINARY ATTRIBUTES:
	- Both states are equally valuable. Have same weight
	- E.g. Gender
- ASYMMETRIC BINARY ATTRIBUTES:
	- Both states are not equally valuable. Don't have same weight.
	- E.g Medical test results or student attendence.

ORDINAL:
- Attribute values have a meaningful order or ranking
- E.g. Grades - A+, A, A-, B ..., or faculty ranks, etc

NUMERICAL:
- Quantitative
- Values - Integer or Real
- INTERVAL SCALED:
	- They are measured on equal size of units
	- E.g. Temperature scale, dates in a calendar
	- Comparable
	- Can find mean, median and mode
	- True Zero point cannot be calculated/exits.
	- Temps in degree Celcius or Farhenheit
- RATIO SCALED:
	- Numeric values with inherent zero-point.
	- One value can be a multiple of another.
	- True Zero point exists
	- Temp in Kelvin


- Discrete and Continuous attributes
	- Discrete are finite number of values
	- May or may not be integers
	- Countably infinite

	- Continuous - numeric atributes
	- Can be Real numbers

- Measure of central tendency
	- Mean, Median, Mode, Midrange
	- Median - L1 + (N/2 - (Sigma[freq]i)/freq(median)) FIND THIS CORRECT FORMULA
	- Unimodal - datasets with one mode
	- Bimodal - datasets with 2 modes
	- Multimodal - 2 or more modes
	- No mode - All values are unique

	- MIDRANGE:
		- Measures central tendency of numeric data set
		- Avg of largest and smallest value in the data set

	- GROUPED MEAN:
		- Find midpoint of the range.
		- Multiply it by freq and find mean.
